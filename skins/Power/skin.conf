    # font. There's a default for almost everything, if not specified below.
    # Nevertheless, I have explicitly put in values, to make it easy to see
    # and understand the options.
    #
    # Fonts can be anything accepted by the Python Imaging Library (PIL), which
    # is currently truetype (.ttf), or PIL's own font format (.pil). See
    # http://www.pythonware.com/library/pil/handbook/imagefont.htm for more
    # details.  Note that "font size" is only used with truetype (.ttf)
    # fonts. For others, font size is determined by the bit-mapped size,
    # usually encoded in the file name (e.g., courB010.pil). If a font cannot
    # be found, then a default font will be used.
    #
    # Colors can be specified any of three ways:
    #   1. Notation 0xBBGGRR;
    #   2. Notation #RRGGBB; or
    #   3. Using an English name, such as 'yellow', or 'blue'.
    # So, 0xff0000, #0000ff, or 'blue' would all specify a pure blue color.
